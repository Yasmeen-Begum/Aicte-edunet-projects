Project Description

Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Waste Classification Data by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: Organic and Recyclable.
Key Details:

    Total Images: 25,077
    
        Training Data: 22,564 images (85%)
    
        Test Data: 2,513 images (15%)
    
    Classes: Organic and Recyclable
    
    Purpose: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.
